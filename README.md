# recommendMe
Simple REST API (more like single endpoint but well...) built with tastedive API (https://tastedive.com/).
Its purpose is to provide recommendations based on user's queries. 

The /recommend endpoint serves general purpose of receiving recommendations and will be used in the upcoming project, so stay tuned :) 

The dialogflow/recommend endpoint is meant for facebook integration with DialogFlow (https://dialogflow.com/) bot framework. Sadly, due to Facebook app review policy and recently released GDPR regulations the bot is not available for non-tester users.

The app has been deployed on Heroku.
